## ⛓️ On-Chain Capabilities

Web3Lancer leverages **Solana** blockchain technology to enable:

- **💸 Instant Cross-Border Payments** - Eliminate traditional banking delays and high fees

In addition, Stellar's fast, low-cost transaction infrastructure powers our payment system, making it possible for freelancers to receive compensation quickly regardless of geographic location.

### 🌟 Stellar-Powered Trust System

Our platform integrates a cutting-edge reputation system built directly on Stellar smart contracts:

- **💯 Transparent Ratings** - All reputation scores are calculated and stored on-chain, ensuring manipulation-proof reviews
- **👥 Verified Reviews** - Only clients and freelancers who have worked together can submit reviews, guaranteed by blockchain verification
- **⚖️ Dispute Resolution** - Fair arbitration process for contested reviews, with full transparency of decisions
- **🔍 Reputation History** - Complete on-chain history of work quality that follows freelancers across projects
- **🧮 Decentralized Scoring** - Reputation scores (0-5) calculated automatically by smart contracts, without central authority

The smart contract efficiently manages user reputation through functions like `submit_review`, `get_reputation_score`, and `dispute_review`, ensuring a trustworthy marketplace for all participants.
