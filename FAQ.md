# FAQ

## What problem are you solving and why is it important?

African businesses and freelancers face high fees, slow transactions, and unreliable infrastructure when making cross-border payments. This limits economic growth, stifles intra-African trade, and excludes many from financial opportunities. Web3Lancer solves this by providing a blockchain-powered platform for seamless, low-cost, and transparent payments across Africa, unlocking new markets, empowering entrepreneurs, and accelerating the continent’s digital economy.

## What's your unique selling proposition — How is your solution different?

Web3Lancer uniquely combines multi-chain blockchain technology (Solana, Stellar, Sui, LayerZero) with AI-powered talent matching and on-chain reputation. Unlike traditional platforms, it enables instant, low-fee, and borderless payments in both crypto and fiat, with transparent escrow and dispute resolution. Our open, decentralized infrastructure empowers African freelancers and businesses to access global markets, build trust, and transact securely—without reliance on banks or intermediaries.
