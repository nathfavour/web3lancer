# LANCERR Whitepaper

## 7. Security Considerations

LANCERR implements multiple layers of security:

- **Formal Verification**: All core smart contracts undergo formal verification
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Ongoing rewards for discovering vulnerabilities
- **Multi-signature Requirements**: For treasury management and protocol upgrades
- **Gradual Decentralization**: Progressive security improvements through community governance
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conducted by independent security firms

## 8. Regulatory Approach

LANCERR aims for regulatory compliance while preserving decentralization:

- **Transparency**: Public documentation of all protocol mechanisms
- **KYC/AML Integration**: Optional verification for higher transaction limits
- **Regulatory Engagement**: Active dialogue with relevant regulatory bodies
- **Privacy Protection**: Compliance with GDPR and similar frameworks

## 9. Economic Analysis

### 9.1 Fee Structure

LANCERR operates with sustainable economics:

- Base network fee: 0.00001 $LANCERR per transaction
- Complex smart contract execution: Variable costs based on computational requirements
- Annual staking yield: 4-7% depending on total staked tokens

### 9.2 Economic Incentive Alignment

The token economy is designed to align incentives for all participants:

- **Validators**: Earn transaction fees and staking rewards
- **Developers**: Receive grants from ecosystem development fund
- **Users**: Benefit from lower fees through staking
