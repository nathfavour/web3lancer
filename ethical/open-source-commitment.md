# Open Source Commitment

## Our Principles

Web3Lancer is committed to the principles of open source software development and the democratization of technology. We believe that transparency, collaboration, and community ownership are fundamental to building a truly decentralized freelancing ecosystem.

## AGPL-3.0 License Choice

We have chosen the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) for the following reasons:

1. **Network Service Protection**: Unlike simpler licenses like MIT, AGPL ensures that even when the software is used to provide a network service, the complete source code must be made available to users.

2. **Copyleft Provisions**: Ensures that all derivatives and modifications remain open source, preventing closed-source forks that could undermine the community.

3. **User Freedom**: Guarantees the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software for all users.

4. **Community Protections**: Prevents corporations from creating proprietary versions of the platform without contributing back to the community.

## Security Without Compromise

Our commitment to open source does not compromise security. We believe that:

1. **Security Through Transparency**: Open code can be audited by anyone, creating stronger security through community oversight.

2. **Robust Authentication**: We implement advanced authentication systems while keeping implementation transparent.

3. **Cryptographic Verification**: Critical operations are verified through cryptographic proof, not through security by obscurity.

4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors, all implemented openly.

5. **Bug Bounty Program**: We maintain an active bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions that enhance:

1. **Platform Security**: Improvements to authentication, authorization, and data protection
2. **Sybil Resistance**: Methods to prevent fake accounts and reputation manipulation
3. **Smart Contract Safety**: Enhanced protections for on-chain operations
4. **Privacy Features**: Better user privacy while maintaining necessary transparency

## Intellectual Property Framework

All contributions to Web3Lancer fall under the AGPL-3.0 license. Contributors retain copyright to their contributions but grant the necessary licenses to distribute the work as part of Web3Lancer.

## Commercial Use

The AGPL-3.0 license permits commercial use of Web3Lancer, provided that:

1. The complete source code (including any modifications) is made available to all users
2. The same license terms are preserved
3. Copyright notices are maintained

This ensures the platform remains free and open while allowing for sustainable business models around support, hosting, and custom development.
